# Azure Data Factory Project: Automated Data Fetching & Conditional Data Copy Pipelines 🚀

## 📈 Project Overview

This project demonstrates automated data ingestion, transformation, monitoring, and notification pipelines built using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**. The core focus areas are:

1. 🌐 **REST API Data Fetching & Storage**
2. 📢 **Database to Data Lake Conditional Data Copy with Child Pipeline Triggering**
3. 📈 **Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard using Power BI**

Additional advanced features include:

* ⏰ Scheduled triggers
* 📊 Parameter passing between pipelines
* 📩 Gmail notifications for operational monitoring
* 📁 Modular and scalable design
* 📉 Visual monitoring using Power BI

## ✅ Tasks Breakdown

### 📌 **Task 1: Fetch Country Data using REST API and Save as JSON**

* **Objective:** Automatically fetch data for five countries via REST API and store as JSON files in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
* **Countries Handled:**
  - India
  - US
  - UK
  - China
  - Russia

* **Details:**
  * API Endpoint: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{country_name}
  * Loop through country list dynamically.
  * Save each country’s JSON response as `{country_name}.json` file in ADLS.

---

### 📌 **Task 2: Create Automated Trigger for Task 1**

* **Objective:** Schedule country data fetching pipeline to run twice daily.
* **Trigger Configuration:**
  * ⏰ 12:00 AM IST
  * ⏰ 12:00 PM IST
* **Benefits:**
  * Eliminates manual execution.
  * Maintains up-to-date country data.

---

### 📌 **Task 3: Conditional Copy of Customer Data from Database to ADLS**

* **Objective:** Copy customer data only when record count exceeds 500.
* **Steps:**
  * Query database to fetch record count.
  * Use If Condition to check: count > 500.
  * If True, copy data from SQL Database to ADLS.
  * Upon success, trigger child pipeline.

---

### 📌 **Task 4: Call Child Product Pipeline if Condition is Met**

* **Objective:** Execute Product Data Pipeline when customer record count exceeds 600.
* **Details:**
  * Pass customer count as a pipeline parameter to child pipeline.
  * Child pipeline handles product data copy based on this parameter.

---

### 📌 **Additional Features 1: Gmail Notification for Status Update (Optional)**

* **Objective:** Notify via Gmail upon success or failure of pipelines.
* **Implementation:**
  * Gmail API / Logic Apps used for notifications.
  * Helps in proactive pipeline monitoring.

---

### 📌 **Additional Features 2: Monitoring Dashboard using Power BI (Optional)**

* **Objective:** Visualize pipeline runs, failures, and data ingestion trends using a Power BI dashboard connected to SQL Server (SSMS).

* **Steps:**
  1. Store pipeline audit logs into SQL Server audit table.
  2. Connect Power BI to SQL Server using SQL Database connector.
  3. Build a monitoring dashboard showing:
     * 📊 Total Pipeline Runs (KPI Card)
     * ✅ Successful Runs (KPI Card)
     * ❌ Failed Runs (KPI Card)
     * 📉 Data Ingested per Day (Bar/Line Chart)
     * 🥧 Success vs. Failure Distribution (Pie Chart)
     * ⚠️ Error Logs (Table View)

* **Benefits:**
  * Centralized monitoring and performance insights.
  * Real-time visibility of pipeline health and data flows.
  * Proactive failure detection using visual dashboards.
